349	United States	Baylor College of Medicine	EMAN2	https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/#EMAN2.3	EMAN2 is the successor to EMAN1. It is a broadly based greyscale scientific image processing suite with a primary focus on processing data from transmission electron microscopes. EMAN's original purpose was performing single particle reconstructions (3-D volumetric models from 2-D cryo-EM images) at the highest possible resolution, but the suite now also offers support for single particle cryo-ET, and tools useful in many other subdisciplines such as helical reconstruction, 2-D crystallography and whole-cell tomography. Image processing in a suite like EMAN differs from consumer image processing packages like Photoshop in that pixels in images are represented as floating-point numbers rather than small (8-16 bit) integers. In addition, image compression is avoided entirely, and there is a focus on quantitative analysis rather than qualitative image display.

674	United States	Anaconda	Numba	https://numba.pydata.org/	Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.    Think of it as a compiler for Python array and numerical functions that gives you the power to speed up your applications with high performance functions written directly in Python.     Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN.    You don't need to replace the Python interpreter, run a separate compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Just apply one of the Numba decorators to your Python function, and Numba does the rest.    Numba generates optimized machine code from pure Python code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. With a few simple annotations, array-oriented and math-heavy Python code can be just-in-time optimized to performance similar as C, C++ and Fortran, without having to switch languages or Python interpreters.    Numba is designed to be used with NumPy arrays and functions. Numba generates specialized code for different array data types and layouts to optimize performance. Special decorators can create universal functions that broadcast over NumPy arrays just like NumPy functions do.    Numba also works great with Jupyter notebooks for interactive computing, and with distributed execution frameworks, like Dask and Spark. With support for GPU acceleration, Numba lets you write parallel GPU algorithms entirely from Python.
